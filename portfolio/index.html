    <div class="openingStatement">
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Asmah Bah and I recently learned how to code in a program with Journi. A little background information about me is that I am currently a senior at Cass technical highschool. My family is originally from Guinea, which is a country in West Africa. Some of my hobbies consist of doing makeup, trying new hobbies, and hanging out with friends.</p>
        <p>Coding for the most part was something completely new to me as of 6 weeks ago. I was briefly introduced to it when i was in elementary school, but always thought of it as something that was way too hard, so for me to complete a 6 week program dedicated to learning code and being comfortable with it is something that I am proud of. I now find coding very enjoyable and later on hope to learn more skills and generally learn more about coding.</p>

    <p>In two years I see myself entering my sophomore year of college. In five years I see myself as a graduate from college and starting a business for myself in the fashion industry.
